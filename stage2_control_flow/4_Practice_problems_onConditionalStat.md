Here are some practice questions to help you master **Conditional Statements** in C, specifically focusing on `if-else` structures and `switch-case` statements:

### **Practice Questions: Conditional Statements**

### 1. **`if`, `else if`, `else` Structures**

#### **Question 1**: Grade Calculator
Write a program that takes a student's score as input (between 0 and 100) and prints their grade using the following criteria:
- **A**: score >= 90
- **B**: score >= 80 but less than 90
- **C**: score >= 70 but less than 80
- **D**: score >= 60 but less than 70
- **F**: score less than 60

#### **Question 2**: Even or Odd
Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks whether the number is even or odd.

#### **Question 3**: Number Comparison
Write a program that takes three integers as input and prints the largest of the three numbers.

#### **Question 4**: Leap Year Check
Write a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

#### **Question 5**: Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

#### **Question 6**: Tax Calculation
Write a program that calculates the income tax to be paid based on the following criteria:
- Income <= 250,000: No tax.
- Income between 250,001 and 500,000: 5% tax on income.
- Income between 500,001 and 1,000,000: 20% tax on income.
- Income above 1,000,000: 30% tax on income.

### 2. **`switch-case` Statements**

#### **Question 7**: Day of the Week
Write a program that takes an integer (1-7) as input, where 1 corresponds to Monday and 7 corresponds to Sunday, and prints the corresponding day of the week.

#### **Question 8**: Basic Calculator
Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation using a `switch-case` statement.

#### **Question 9**: Vowel or Consonant
Write a program that takes a character as input and checks whether it is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or a consonant using a `switch-case` statement.

#### **Question 10**: Month of the Year
Write a program that takes an integer (1-12) as input and prints the corresponding month of the year (1 for January, 2 for February, and so on).

#### **Question 11**: Calculator with Error Handling
Modify the basic calculator program to handle cases where the user enters an invalid operator by displaying an error message.

#### **Question 12**: Seasons of the Year
Write a program that takes an integer as input representing a month (1-12) and prints the corresponding season using a `switch-case` statement:
- Winter: December (12), January (1), February (2)
- Spring: March (3), April (4), May (5)
- Summer: June (6), July (7), August (8)
- Autumn: September (9), October (10), November (11)

### **Bonus Questions**

#### **Bonus Question 1**: Triangle Validity
Write a program that takes three angles as input and checks whether they form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of the angles is exactly 180 degrees.

#### **Bonus Question 2**: Simple Interest or Compound Interest
Write a program that takes an integer as input (1 or 2), where:
- 1 represents Simple Interest calculation.
- 2 represents Compound Interest calculation.
Use a `switch-case` statement to choose between the two types of interest and calculate accordingly.

### **Key Concepts to Practice**:
- Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` to evaluate different conditions.
- Understanding the flow of conditions and handling edge cases.
- Practicing `switch-case` for decision-making based on discrete values.
- Mastering nested conditional statements (like nested `if` and `switch` cases) for more complex scenarios.

These questions will help you get a solid grasp of decision-making in C programming using conditional statements.
