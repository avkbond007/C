Here are 10 practice questions each for **Arrays**, **Strings**, and **Pointers** to help reinforce your understanding.

### **Practice Questions on Arrays**

1. **Basic Array Manipulation:**  
   Write a program to initialize an array with 10 integers. Find the maximum and minimum value in the array.
   
2. **Reversing an Array:**  
   Write a function to reverse the elements of an array of integers.

3. **Array Rotation:**  
   Given an array of integers, rotate the array to the right by `n` steps. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the result should be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Sum of Elements in an Array:**  
   Write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given array of integers.

5. **Merging Two Arrays:**  
   Given two sorted arrays, write a function to merge them into a single sorted array.

6. **2D Array Multiplication:**  
   Write a program to perform matrix multiplication on two 2D arrays of integers.

7. **Find Duplicates in an Array:**  
   Write a program to find and print all the duplicate elements in an array.

8. **Count Occurrences in an Array:**  
   Given an array and a number `x`, count the occurrences of `x` in the array.

9. **Find the Second Largest Element:**  
   Write a function to find the second largest element in an array of integers.

10. **Array Sorting:**  
    Implement bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort on an array of integers.

### **Practice Questions on Strings**

1. **String Length:**  
   Write a function to calculate the length of a string without using the `strlen()` function.

2. **Reverse a String:**  
   Write a function to reverse a given string.

3. **Check for Palindrome:**  
   Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

4. **String Concatenation:**  
   Write a function to concatenate two strings without using the `strcat()` function.

5. **Find Substring:**  
   Write a function to check if a given substring exists in a string and return its starting index, or -1 if not found.

6. **Count Vowels and Consonants:**  
   Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

7. **Convert Case:**  
   Write a function to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa in a string.

8. **Remove Duplicates from String:**  
   Write a function that removes all duplicate characters from a string.

9. **Compare Two Strings:**  
   Implement a function to compare two strings without using the `strcmp()` function.

10. **Word Count in a String:**  
    Write a function to count the number of words in a string (words are separated by spaces).

### **Practice Questions on Pointers**

1. **Pointer Basics:**  
   Write a program to demonstrate the use of pointers by swapping two integers using a function that takes pointers as arguments.

2. **Pointer Arithmetic:**  
   Write a program to iterate over an array using a pointer and pointer arithmetic (instead of array indexing).

3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**  
   Write a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers, accepts input from the user, and then deallocates the memory using `free()`.

4. **Pointer to Pointer:**  
   Write a program that demonstrates the concept of pointer-to-pointer by printing a value using triple pointers.

5. **Passing Arrays to Functions:**  
   Write a function that takes an array (using pointers) as an argument and returns the sum of its elements.

6. **String Manipulation with Pointers:**  
   Write a function to reverse a string using pointers.

7. **NULL Pointers:**  
   Write a program that creates a pointer, assigns it to NULL, and safely checks if the pointer is NULL before dereferencing it.

8. **Pointer and Structure:**  
   Define a structure for a `Person` with fields for `name`, `age`, and `address`. Write a program to create a `Person` and access its fields using pointers.

9. **Dynamic 2D Array:**  
   Write a program to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array using pointers and then free the allocated memory.

10. **Pointer to Functions:**  
    Write a program that uses a pointer to a function to perform a calculation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply) based on user input.
