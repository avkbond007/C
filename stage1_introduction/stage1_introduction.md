   - Writing basic programs like "Hello, World!".
   - Comments and documentation.

3. **Data Types and Variables**
   - Integer types (`int`, `short`, `long`), floating-point types (`float`, `double`), and `char`.
   - Constants (`const`, `#define`).
   - Input/Output using `printf()` and `scanf()`.

4. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
   - Relational (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
   - Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`) and bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`).

### **Stage 1: Introduction to C Programming - Basic Syntax and Structure**

#### 1. **`#include <stdio.h>` and the `main()` function**
   The **`#include`** directive and the **`main()`** function are the foundation of any C program. Here's a breakdown:

   - **`#include <stdio.h>`**: 
     - This is a preprocessor directive, which tells the compiler to include the **Standard Input Output** library before compiling the program. This library contains functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`, which are used for input and output operations.
     - Without this line, you cannot use `printf()` (which is used to print output) or other standard I/O functions.
     - Think of it as telling the compiler, "Please load the necessary tools for input/output operations."

   - **`main()` function**: 
     - Every C program must have a `main()` function, as it is the entry point of the program. The program starts executing from the first statement inside `main()`.
     - The **`int`** before `main()` specifies the return type of the function. The `main()` function generally returns an integer (`int`), and the return value of 0 usually indicates that the program executed successfully.
     - The structure of `main()` is typically:
       ```c
       int main() {
           // Your code here
           return 0;
       }
       ```
       - `return 0;` tells the operating system that the program finished successfully. You can change this to other values (non-zero) to indicate errors.

#### 2. **Writing a Basic Program: "Hello, World!"**
   The **"Hello, World!"** program is one of the simplest programs you can write to understand the structure of a C program. Here’s an example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output header

   int main() {        // Main function
       printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
       return 0;       // Exit the program with a success status
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `#include <stdio.h>`: Tells the compiler to include the standard I/O library so you can use functions like `printf()`.
     - `int main() { ... }`: This defines the `main()` function, where the execution of your program begins.
     - `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. The `\n` is a special character called a **newline** character, which moves the cursor to the next line.
     - `return 0;`: This returns 0, which indicates that the program executed successfully.

   - **Output**: When you run this program, you will see the following output on the screen:
     ```
     Hello, World!
     ```

#### 3. **Comments and Documentation**
   Comments in C are used to add descriptions, explanations, or notes within the code. They are ignored by the compiler and are used purely for the benefit of the programmer. Comments help in documenting the code and making it easier to understand for others (or even yourself when revisiting the code later).

   - **Single-line comments**:
     - Use `//` for single-line comments. Anything written after `//` on that line is ignored by the compiler.
     - Example:
       ```c
       // This is a single-line comment
       printf("Hello, World!\n");  // This prints "Hello, World!"
       ```

   - **Multi-line comments**:
     - Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments. Anything between `/*` and `*/` is ignored by the compiler, regardless of how many lines it spans.
     - Example:
       ```c
       /*
         This is a multi-line comment.
         It can span multiple lines.
       */
       printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Prints "Hello, World!"
       ```

   - **Why use comments?**
     - They are useful for:
       - Explaining what a section of code does.
       - Temporarily disabling code while debugging.
       - Providing details about the logic or purpose of the code, making it easier to maintain or share with other developers.

#### Example with Comments:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Include standard I/O library

int main() {
    // Print "Hello, World!" to the screen
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

- **Purpose of comments**: In the above code, the comments explain each step of the program. While comments don’t affect the functionality of the code, they provide useful explanations and make it easier for others to understand what’s happening.

### **Key Points Recap**
1. **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This includes the standard input/output library so we can use functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.
2. **`main()` function**: The starting point of the program. It typically returns an integer value to indicate success or failure.
3. **`printf()`**: Used to print output to the console.
4. **Comments**: Used for documentation. Single-line comments use `//`, and multi-line comments use `/* ... */`.

With these basics understood, you are now ready to write more C programs! Start with simple programs, gradually adding more functionality as you learn about loops, conditions, and functions.
